      <h2>The Rule of Ramses II</h2>
      <p>
        Ramses II, often called Ramses the Great, was one of Ancient Egypt's
        most powerful and celebrated pharaohs. His reign marked a golden era for
        Egypt, characterized by monumental architecture, military campaigns, and
        a flourishing culture. Known for his ambitious building projects, Ramses
        II commissioned the construction of temples, statues, and cities that
        showcased the grandeur of his rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key highlight of Ramses' reign was the signing of the first known
        peace treaty in history with the Hittites after the Battle of Kadesh.
        His leadership and vision left a lasting legacy, influencing Egypt and
        the world for generations.
